Problem Statement
There are N cities where Alice’s city is 1 and Bob’s city is N. There are M bi-directional roads between any two cities having a certain length. As Alice and Bob are childhood friends they want to meet  again in a city such that the 
The absolute difference between the distance traveled by Alice and the distance traveled by Bob is as minimal as possible.
Write a program to determine the minimum absolute difference between the distance traveled by Alice and the distance traveled by Bob. If they can’t meet then report -1.
Input Format
The first line of input will be two integers “N” and “M” denoting the number of cities and the number of paths.
The next M lines of input will be 3 integers a,b, c denoting a bi-directional road between a and b of length c.
Output Format
print a single integer denoting the minimum absolute difference between the distance traveled by Alice and the distance traveled by Bob. If they can’t meet then print -1.
Constraints
2<= N , M <= 10^3
1<= a,b<= N;
1<= c <= 10^5

Testcase Output
1
Explanation
If they meet at node 5 then the distance traveled by Alice is 5 and distance traveled by Bob is 4 and the absolute difference is 1. It is the minimum absolute difference.

Problem Statement
In a futuristic data processing system, you are assigned the task of optimizing bitwise computations for high-speed transmissions. The system receives three integers: X, Y, and Z, representing encrypted signals. Your mission is to decode the bitwise relationship between X and Y, apply specialized shifting techniques, and mask the results based on Z.
However, due to signal interference, the system requires a dynamic shifting approach rather than a fixed shift operation. Additionally, a custom masking technique is needed to ensure secure transmission. Your task is to perform the following operations and provide the processed results.
Operations to Perform:
1. Bitwise Analysis:
    * 		Compute the AND, OR, and XOR results of X and Y.
2. Secure Masking for Transmission:
    * 		Generate a bitmask from Z:
        * 		If Z is even, the bitmask is ((1 << (Z % 10)) - 1).
        * 		If Z is odd, the bitmask is ((1 << (Z % 5 + 2)) - 1).
    * 		Apply the bitmask to AND, OR, and XOR results using bitwise AND with the mask to ensure secure transmission.
Your challenge is to successfully process the data and output the transformed values while maintaining integrity under these dynamic constraints.
Input Format
The First line contains an integer X, representing the first signal.
The Second line contains an integer Y, representing the second signal.
The Third line contains an integer Z, used for shifting and masking.
Output Format
Print results of AND, OR, XOR operations in separate line.
Print Generated Bitmask.
Print the masked versions of AND, OR, XOR results in separate line.
Constraints
-10^6 <= X, Y, Z <= 10^6
